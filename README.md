## IDE
 Official IDE with Plutus compilation support is available at [kuberide.com/ide](https://kuberide.com/kuber/login/?state=\%2fide)

## Example Project using Kuber
[cardano-marketplace](https://github.com/dQuadrant/cardano-marketplace)


# Run Kuber-Server with docker-compose

Kuber can be stared easily with [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file. But you will have to wait for cardano-node to sync to latest block

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dquadrant/kuber.git
git checkout 3.1.2
docker-compose up -d
```


If you want to build docker image locally, you can use the helper script
```bash
$ ./.ci/build
```

## Developer guide
Instructions for local development of kuber is available in [DEVELOPER.md](DEVELOPER.md)
