This failure typically occurs when not all head members successfully post their commit transactions to lock their UTxOs into the head. A party can then post an abort transaction on the mainchain. This transaction transitions the mainchain state machine directly from the initial state to the final state, bypassing the open and closed states.

This effectively makes the funds or state represented by that UTxO available for standard layer-one operations again.
